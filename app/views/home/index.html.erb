    A device runs until either of two components fails, at which point the device stops running. The joint density
    function of the lifetimes of the two components, both measured in hours, is

    f (x,y)=x+y/8 for 0< x < 2 and 0< y < 2 .
    <h5>What is the probability that the device fails during its first hour of operation?</h5>

    An insurer offers a health plan to the employees of a large company. As part of this plan, the individual employees
    may choose exactly two of the supplementary coverages A, B, and C, or they may choose no supplementary coverage. The
    proportions of the company's employees that choose coverages A, B, and C are 1?4 , 1?3 and 5?12 respectively.
    <h5>Determine the probability that a randomly chosen employee will choose no supplementary coverage.</h5>

    A tour operator has a bus that can accommodate 20 tourists. The operator knows that tourists may not show up, so he
    sells 21 tickets.
    The probability that an individual tourist will not show up is 0.02, independent of all other tourists. Each ticket
    costs 50, and is
    non-refundable if a tourist fails to show up. If a tourist shows up and a seat is not available, the tour operator
    has to pay 100
    (ticket cost + 50 penalty) to the tourist.
    <h5>What is the expected revenue of the tour operator?</h5>
